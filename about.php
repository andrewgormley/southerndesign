            At SoutHern Design we care about the service and installation of each and every job we do.
          </p>
          <p>
            This starts with the survey. Our surveyors are experienced in window fitting, which means each job is surveyed to offer the best job efficiency and attention to detail resulting in a top quality and professional service, fitted to the highest of standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Installation and finishing standards are extremely important to us. To achieve this we only employ the very best experienced and well trained staff. Once completed, all of our work is checked by the lead fitters.
